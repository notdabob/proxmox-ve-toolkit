# Documentation Instructions

## Documentation Standards

### Writing Style

- Write in clear, concise English
- Use active voice when possible
- Structure content with logical headings and subheadings
- Include practical examples and code snippets
- Keep paragraphs focused and not overly long

### Markdown Formatting

- Use consistent heading levels (start with # for main title, ## for sections)
- Use code blocks with appropriate language highlighting
- Include table of contents for longer documents
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity
- Format code inline with backticks for short snippets

Example structure:

````markdown
# Document Title

- Consider the impact of documentation changes on users
- Keep documentation in sync with code releases

## Special Documentation Types

### API Documentation
