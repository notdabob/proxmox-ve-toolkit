# Scripts Directory Structure

This directory contains cross-platform installer and utility scripts for the AI Code Assist Boilerplate.

## Structure

- `shell/` — POSIX shell scripts (sh, bash, zsh)
- `powershell/` — PowerShell scripts and modules

## Usage

Run the unified installer:

```sh
sh scripts/shell/install.sh
```

Or from any shell (sh/zsh/bash):

```sh
./scripts/shell/install.sh
```

PowerShell modules and scripts are in `scripts/powershell/`.

Refer to each script for platform-specific details.
